# 🪾 Weirwood.net

**ASOIAF Prophecy Tracker & Connection Engine** — A literary analysis tool that catalogs every known prophecy in *A Song of Ice and Fire*, tracks fulfillment status, and uses AI to surface non-obvious relationships between them.

Built with React, FastAPI, D3.js, and Claude AI. Demonstrates entity extraction, relationship mapping, streaming AI responses, and graph visualization.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weirwood-net.git
cd weirwood-net
cp .env.example .env           # Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
docker compose up --build      # Open http://localhost:5173
```

## 📖 What It Does

Weirwood.net is a searchable, filterable prophecy database with AI-powered connection discovery. Browse 75 hand-curated prophecies across all 5 books, find thematic links between them using Claude AI, analyze which prophecies a given event fulfills, and generate TWOW predictions — all with streaming responses and persistent caching.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Browse & Filter** — Dashboard with card/table views, full-text search (FTS5), filtering by book, type, status, character
- 🕸️ **AI Connection Finder** — Click "Find Connections" on any prophecy to discover thematic parallels, shared fulfillments, contradictions, and sequential links via Claude AI
- ⚖️ **Fulfillment Analyzer** — Describe any event (real or hypothetical) and see which prophecies it might fulfill, with confidence scores and reasoning
- ❄️ **TWOW Predictions** — Per-prophecy predictions and comprehensive global reports for The Winds of Winter, with real-time token streaming
- 🌐 **Graph Explorer** — D3 force-directed network graph showing prophecy connections. Nodes colored by type, sized by connection count. Zoom, pan, drag, filter.
- 📥 **Export** — Download any prophecy's full analysis (connections + predictions) as Markdown

**Key design decisions:**
- **SQLite over PostgreSQL** — Dataset is small (~75 prophecies), read-heavy, single-user. SQLite eliminates infrastructure complexity and makes Docker setup trivial.
- **SSE over WebSockets** — AI analysis is unidirectional (server → client). SSE is simpler, auto-reconnects, and matches the Anthropic SDK's streaming API.
- **Non-streaming AI + streaming transport** — Claude returns complete JSON for structured output (connections, fulfillment matches). SSE delivers validated results progressively. Token streaming used only for prose (predictions).
- **Persisted connections with refresh** — AI-generated connections are stored in SQLite for instant load on revisit. "Regenerate" button allows fresh analysis.
- **D3.js direct, not a wrapper** — Full control over force simulation, zoom, drag, tooltips, and visual encoding.

## 💻 Development

### ⚙️ Without Docker

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend && uv run pytest -v

# Frontend tests
cd frontend && npx vitest run

# Type checking
cd backend && uv run mypy app/ --ignore-missing-imports
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit
```

### 📜 Adding Prophecies

Edit `backend/app/seed/prophecies.json` following the existing entry format. Delete `backend/data/weirwood.db` and restart the backend to re-seed.

Required fields: `title`, `description`, `source_character`, `source_chapter`, `source_book` (1-5), `prophecy_type`, `status`, `subject_characters` (array), `keywords` (array).

## 🔮 AI Prompt Design

The AI prompts use **evidence-constrained reasoning** — Claude is instructed to cite specific chapters and scenes, not speculate beyond the text. Connection types (thematic_parallel, shared_fulfillment, contradiction, sequential, reinterpretation) provide structured output that can be validated and stored.

All AI responses are validated before display: prophecy IDs checked against the database, confidence values clamped to 0-1, connection types verified against the enum. Invalid results are silently dropped.
